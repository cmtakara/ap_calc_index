    <ol>
        <h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
        <li>Justify conclusions about functions by applying the Mean Value Theorem over an interval. <br/>
            <ul>
                <li>If a function <i>f</i> is continuous over the interval [<i>a, b</i>] and differentiable	over the interval (<i>a, b</i>), then the Mean Value Theorem guarantees a point within that open interval where the instantaneous rate of change equals the average rate of change over the interval.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Mean Value Theorem</h3>
    <ol>Conditions
        <li>f(x) must be continuous on the closed interval [a, b]</li>
        <li>f(x) must be differentiable on the open interval (a,b)</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>If the conditions are met:</h4>
    <p>The Mean Value Theorem guarantees that there is at least one value c on the interval (a, b) such that: <img src="../../images/unit_5/MVT.png"/>
        <ul>
            <li>f'(c) represents the instantaneous rate of change (slope of the tangent line) at point c. </li>
            <li><img src = "../../images/unit_5/MVT_slope.png"/>represents the average rate of change over the interval [a,b] (slope of the secant line). </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Rolle's Theorem</h3>
    <p>Rolle's Theorem is a specialized case of the Mean Value Theorem.  There is one additional condition that needs to be met:
        <ul>
            <li>The functions values at the endpoints must be equal, meaning f(a) = f(b).</li>
        </ul>
        This additional condition being met, while the other two are true, leads to the guarantee of the existence of a point c where the slope of the tangent line is zero, indicating a horizontal tangent.
